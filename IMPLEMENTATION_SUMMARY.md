# 🏰 Tower Defense Game - Implementation Complete!

## ✅ What Has Been Built

A complete, multiplayer tower defense game built from scratch following OOP principles, with a React frontend and FastAPI backend.

### Backend (Python/FastAPI)
**Location:** `backend/`

#### Clean OOP Architecture:
- **`models/tower.py`**: Tower base class with 4 subclasses
  - `BasicTower`: Balanced stats
  - `SniperTower`: Long range, low damage (best on mountains)
  - `CannonTower`: High damage, slow speed (best on lakes)
  - `AoETower`: Area-of-effect attacks
  - Terrain bonuses: Mountains (+50% range, -30% damage), Lakes (+50% damage, -40% speed)
  - 3 upgrade paths: damage, range, speed
  - Max level: 5

- **`models/enemy.py`**: Enemy base class with 3 subclasses
  - `FastEnemy`: Low HP, high speed, weak to AoE
  - `TankEnemy`: High HP, slow speed, weak to Cannon
  - `FlyingEnemy`: Medium stats, resistant to ground towers, weak to Sniper
  - Each enemy type has unique resistances and weaknesses

- **`models/player.py`**: Player management
  - Starting money: 500
  - Starting lives: 20
  - Tracks: money, points, lives, towers built, enemies defeated

- **`models/game_map.py`**: Procedural map generation
  - 20x20 grid with random road generation
  - Terrain types: Plains, Mountains, Lakes, Roads
  - A* pathfinding for enemy movement
  - Mountain and lake clusters for strategic placement

- **`models/game.py`**: Main game logic
  - Wave system with increasing difficulty
  - Enemy spawning and management
  - Tower attack coordination
  - Multiplayer player management
  - Game state synchronization

- **`main.py`**: FastAPI server
  - WebSocket for real-time multiplayer
  - REST API endpoints for game actions
  - Background game loop (10 updates/second)
  - Automatic game state broadcasting

### Frontend (React)
**Location:** `frontend/src/`

#### Components:
- **`App.jsx`**: Main application with WebSocket connection
  - Real-time game state updates
  - Player action handling
  - Message notifications
  - Game over detection

- **`components/GameCanvas.jsx`**: Canvas-based renderer

  - Enemy rendering with health bars
  - Range indicators
  - Attack animations

- **`components/TowerMenu.jsx`**: Tower selection UI
  - 4 tower types with stats
  - Cost display
  - Affordability checking
  - Terrain bonus information

- **`components/PlayerStats.jsx`**: Player info display
  - Money, lives, points
  - Towers built, enemies defeated
  - Real-time updates

- **`components/WaveInfo.jsx`**: Wave status
  - Current wave number
  - Enemy count
  - Wave progress
  - Start wave button

- **`App.css`**: Mobile-first responsive design
  - Dark theme
  - Touch-friendly controls
  - Responsive layout
  - Smooth animations

## 🎮 Game Features

### Core Mechanics
- ✅ **Random Map Generation**: Each game has a unique map with roads, mountains, and lakes
- ✅ **Strategic Tower Placement**: Terrain affects tower performance
- ✅ **Wave System**: Enemies spawn in waves with increasing difficulty
- ✅ **Tower Upgrades**: 3 upgrade paths per tower, up to level 5
- ✅ **Multiple Enemy Types**: 3 enemy types with unique behaviors
- ✅ **Real-time Multiplayer**: Multiple players can collaborate on the same game
- ✅ **Economy System**: Earn money by defeating enemies, spend on towers
- ✅ **Lives System**: Game over when all lives are lost

### Tower Types
1. **Basic Tower** (💰100): Balanced, works anywhere
2. **Sniper Tower** (💰150): Long range, targets furthest enemy
3. **Cannon Tower** (💰200): High damage, slow attack
4. **AoE Tower** (💰250): Attacks multiple enemies

### Enemy Types
1. **Fast Enemy** 🟢: Low HP, high speed
2. **Tank Enemy** 🔴: High HP, slow speed
3. **Flying Enemy** 🔵: Medium stats, resistant to ground towers

### Terrain System
- **🌿 Plains**: Standard stats
- **🏔️ Mountains**: +50% range, -30% damage (great for Sniper towers)
- **💧 Lakes**: +50% damage, -40% speed (great for Cannon towers)
- **🛣️ Roads**: Cannot place towers, enemies follow these paths

## 🚀 How to Run

### Start Backend:
```bash
./start-backend.sh
```
Backend runs on: http://localhost:8000

### Start Frontend:
```bash
./start-frontend.sh
```
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5173

### Or manually:
**Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
uv run --no-project python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install  # if not already done
npm run dev
```

## 🎯 Key Technical Achievements

### Backend
- ✅ Clean OOP with proper inheritance hierarchies
- ✅ Factory patterns for tower/enemy creation
- ✅ Procedural map generation with pathfinding
- ✅ Real-time WebSocket multiplayer
- ✅ Efficient game loop with state synchronization
- ✅ Type hints throughout for better IDE support

### Frontend

## 🎨 Design Principles

1. **Object-Oriented Programming**: Clean class hierarchies with inheritance
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Models, API, and rendering are separate
3. **Mobile-First**: Responsive design works on all devices
4. **Real-Time**: WebSocket ensures all players see updates instantly
5. **Scalable**: Easy to add new tower types, enemy types, or terrain features

## 🔧 Dependencies

### Backend
- fastapi >= 0.115.0

## 🎮 Gameplay Tips

1. **Start with Basic towers** to establish defense
2. **Place Sniper towers on mountains** for maximum coverage
3. **Place Cannon towers on lakes** for devastating damage
4. **Use AoE towers** where enemies cluster
5. **Upgrade strategically** based on enemy wave composition
6. **Save money** for emergencies and later waves
7. **Watch enemy types** - each has different weaknesses

## 🐛 Known Limitations

- Single game instance (all players share one game)
- No save/load functionality
- No sound effects (can be added)
- Game resets when server restarts

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- Multiple game rooms
- More tower types
- More enemy types
- Boss waves
- Power-ups
- Sound effects and music
- Persistent leaderboards
- Player authentication
- Mobile app version
